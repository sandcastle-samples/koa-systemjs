# Koa & System.js

> A seed project for Koa.js, System.js & Typescript


## Roadmap

- Add support for production builds (currently only development workflow supported)
- Convert into yeoman generator


## Scripts

The below helper scripts are available for convenience:

- `script/setup` - sets up the repo for the first time
- `script/update` - run after pulling latest from the repo
- `script/clean` - cleans all temporary directories used for build and packaging
- `script/test` - run all the tests
- `script/lint` - lint all source files
- `script/server` - run the application locally
- `script/build` - build the application
- `script/package` - packages the app as a docker container (must be run after `script/build`)
